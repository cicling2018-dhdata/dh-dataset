# Python Sources

In this directory you find the main Python sources of the project, esp for model evaluation.
See the parent directory for main documentation.
 

## Interesting files

Most relevant might be `config.py`, where you can for example switch from uni-gram (default) to n-gram datasets. 
Furthermore, if you want to add your own models, have to extend `config.py` with the respective new block.

Calling the evaluation files is discussed in the main project documentation (parent directory).
